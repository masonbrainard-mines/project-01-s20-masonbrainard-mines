This code is all C++ as that is what I have the most expierence with.

X and O are for if a command runs successfully or not

I'm not a CS major, and don't have expierence with makefiles sorry. Here is the command to run from within the folder to run the code.
g++ shell.cc builtin.cc history.cc alias.cc parser.cc
./a.out

As a heads up, a couple things don't work.
